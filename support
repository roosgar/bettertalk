# BetterTalk Support

BetterTalk is a mobile app designed to help users understand how their messages may be interpreted before sending them.

The app reveals communication signals such as tone, clarity, and misinterpretation risk, and offers alternative ways to express the same message more clearly.

## Common Questions

**Does BetterTalk read my messages automatically?**  
No. BetterTalk only processes text that you choose to paste into the app.

**Does BetterTalk store my messages?**  
Messages are not stored on our servers. Recent messages may be kept locally on your device to support app functionality.

**Does the app send messages for me?**  
No. BetterTalk does not send, post, or automate messages.
