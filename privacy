# Privacy Policy — BetterTalk

**Last updated:** March 2026

BetterTalk is designed with privacy as a core principle. The app is built to minimize data collection and give users full control over what they share.

## Information We Process
BetterTalk processes text that users **explicitly paste into the app** in order to analyze communication signals and generate alternative message suggestions.

The app does **not** automatically read messages, access inboxes, contacts, or monitor communications.

## How Information Is Used
- Text is processed only when the user chooses to analyze a message.
- Text is sent temporarily to an AI service to generate feedback requested by the user.
- The information is **not used for advertising**, tracking, or profiling.

## Data Storage
- BetterTalk does not require accounts or logins.
- Message content is **not permanently stored on our servers**.
- Recent messages may be stored **locally on the user’s device** to support app functionality.
- Deleting the app removes any locally stored data.

## Third-Party Services
BetterTalk uses third-party AI services solely to process user-submitted text and return analysis results. These services are used only to provide app functionality.

## Data Sharing
BetterTalk does not sell or share user data for marketing or advertising purposes.

## User Control
Users are responsible for deciding what content they enter into the app. BetterTalk does not send messages on a user’s behalf.
